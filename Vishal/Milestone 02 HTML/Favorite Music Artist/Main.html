    <p>Dino James is a rapper and he rap in his own style. As per his one interview he belongs to Bhopal. He struggled a lot in Mumbai later on he went back to his home . After sometimes he realized that no he has to do something but he was clueless. Basically he was trying to do something in acting field and he has done few small roles. According to him once he was sitting on a beach in Mumbai from somewhere any guy came with guitar and sat beside him, played some tone instantly Dino reacted on that music and asked how you have done this. That guy responded because Dino was also use to play guitar before and he got the idea from there. He went back to his room where he shares his idea whith his roommate. He was going through breakup kind of situation along with the struggle to do something , so from there he started rapping and released his first Song called “Girlfriend”. Sorry If i am wrong or my information but what ever i came know about him is this. He is one of my favourite rapper and he is doing different and better in HIP HOP and rapping field. He consider that guy as a god who came near to him and asked him to do something in this field and he chose that line make something different. I think youth Love them.</p><br><br>
